1;Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek & Lip Tint;5;Love this! The ingredients, the formula, the color, and the range to look like a flush of color to dramatic red. PLEASE make more color options!;https://www.ulta.com/p/beetroot-cheek-lip-tint-pimprod2029283?AID=164999&PID=3006986&CID=af_164999_3006986_&clickId=RLyw37TKlxyLWENwUx0Mo3QnUkFV0p0Re0ikzo0&SubID=&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=3006986&utm_campaign=&utm_content=core&irgwc=1
2;Benefit Liquid Lip Blush & Cheek Tint;4;I like to color and that I can drink something without leaving a lipstick stain. The only negative I have is that there is a odd taste that lasts for a while after you apply the stain.;https://www.ulta.com/p/liquid-lip-blush-cheek-tint-pimprod2008308?sku=2547736
3;Winky Lux Barely There Lip Tint;3;I really loved this, the reason for only 3 stars is that only 2/3 of the product was accessible. The product in the bottom was impossible to reach with the short wand. I took the plastic top of and that allowed more movement of the wand but I still had a lot of product that I could not get to. It felt like a big waste. If you could fix your packaging it would be the best product ever!;https://www.ulta.com/p/barely-there-tinted-lip-oil-pimprod2030860?sku=2590426
4;Benefit Liquid Lip Blush & Cheek Tint;2;Got the Benetint to try, used it a few times and its not all that great, especially for the price..save your money! Dries our your lips, stain doesn't last at all so I ended up returning it.

5;Pixi TintFix Satin Lip Tint;1;This is not a lip stain. It goes on your lips more like a mousse and it doesn't dry down but also does not stain your lips. It looks dry and cakey on your lips!

8;Treslúce Beauty Bold y Atrevida Liquid Lip Tint;3;I liked how easy this was to apply to my lips and the color is popping!

17;Benefit Liquid Lip Blush & Cheek Tint;4;This product is ok, but the price is ridiculous and I am not a fan of the application process.

18;Caliray Socal Superbloom LipTint ;3;The color is more a bright red than pink and the consistency is strange…it doesn’t feel like a lip product, which is primarily what I wanted it for.

19;Essence What A Tint! Lip & Cheek Tint;2;It came opend. I thought I could look past that because it didnt spill, i was wrong. It is very patchy and dries extremely fast.

29;L.A. Girl Gloss Tint Lip Stain;2; I got the shade Captivating. Smelled very strongly of chemicals. The color was not a sophisticated red, more like I just ate a cherry popsicle red. After applying I waited about 30 mins before gently blotting some product away with a tissue. No stain left at all.

63;Bobbi Brown Extra Lip Tint;3;I typically love Bobbi Brown lip products, but I think I will return this one. I bought the color Bare Blackberry, and there is almost no color to it.

78;Caliray Socal Superbloom LipTint ;3;I have mixed emotions about this product. Its definitely hydrating, and the color is nice but the product itself is not as thick as i would have wanted for a lip product.

81;Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek & Lip Tint;5;This is the best lip stain ever. First big plus for me are the ingredients which don't seem like the other lip stains out there. Second, the stain itself is beautiful. I apply a thick layer first and let it dry and then wipe the excess. I am left with a beautiful stain that does not budge!

84;L.A. Girl Gloss Tint Lip Stain;2;It's a good stain for this price point, but I won't be purchasing it again due to the smell and taste. It has a very strong chemical smell that lingers.

182;Treslúce Beauty Bold y Atrevida Liquid Lip Tint;4;I really like the color, Mesmerize, and it does last most of the day and stains a little bit.

183;Revlon Kiss Cushion Lip Tint;3;The consistancy is very thick and it does transfer unless you blot it afterwards The edges can be hard to get completely smooth and straight so will require either a lip liner or a brush to perfect the outline of your lips.

186;Pixi TintFix Satin Lip Tint;5;Adore is the perfect shade if you're looking for a tint with a little pop that won't rub off.

188;Winky Lux Barely There Lip Tint;3;Formula is not sticky and doesn't have a strong scent. Will have to see if it works. The doe foot was bent 90 degrees when I first opened the package.

189;Benefit Liquid Lip Blush & Cheek Tint;2;It's very difficult to apply this product because of how liquidy it is, and it also takes a while to dry.

198;Dior Addict Lip Tint;3;I like the color but first it takes time to wear it. Secondly it should be non transferable.
